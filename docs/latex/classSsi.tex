\hypertarget{classSsi_ssiDescription}{}\doxysubsection{S\+S\+I Description}\label{classSsi_ssiDescription}
The T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM microcontroller has four S\+SI modules. The S\+SI is used to communicate with peripheral devices that have the Freescale S\+PI, Microwire or TI S\+SI interfaces. Each S\+SI module can act as a master or slave. The T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM microcontroller S\+SI modules have the following features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Programmable interface operation for Freescale S\+PI, M\+I\+C\+R\+O\+W\+I\+RE, or Texas Instruments synchronous serial interfaces
\item Master or slave operation
\item Programmable clock bit rate and prescaler
\item Separate transmit and receive F\+I\+F\+Os, each 16 bits wide and 8 locations deep
\item Programmable data frame size from 4 to 16 bits
\item Internal loopback test mode for diagnostic/debug testing
\item Standard F\+I\+F\+O-\/based interrupts and End-\/of-\/\+Transmission interrupt
\item Efficient transfers using Micro Direct Memory Access Controller (Âµ\+D\+MA)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Separate channels for transmit and receive
\item Receive single request asserted when data is in the F\+I\+FO; burst request asserted when F\+I\+FO contains 4 entries
\item Transmit single request asserted when there is space in the F\+I\+FO; burst request asserted when four or more entries are available to be written in the F\+I\+FO
\end{DoxyItemize}

Background information first, Freescale is a spinoff of Motorolla and was purchased by N\+XP Semiconductor. Motorola developed S\+PI in the mid 80s. "The Serial Peripheral Interface (S\+PI) bus was put together by Motorola (Freescale/\+N\+X\+P/\+Qualcomm) in the 1980s for communicating between a processor and one or more external peripherals. S\+PI is intended for short distance communication, typically between chips on the same board." \href{https://embedded.fm/blog/2017/3/24/i-spi}{\texttt{ https\+://embedded.\+fm/blog/2017/3/24/i-\/spi}}

Generally, S\+PI is a name given to 4-\/wire serial communication protocol that is full duplex and uses a master-\/slave communication architecture with a single master (with the option of multiple slaves). While most S\+PI interfaces and protocol impelementations are the same and compatable with each other, {\bfseries{ S\+O\+ME A\+RE N\+O\+T!!! }} Care must be taken to ensure that the S\+PI interfaces are compatable. According to Wikipedia, "the S\+PI bus is a de facto standard but not officially established. The lack of a formal standard is reflected in a wide variety of protocol options. Different word sizes are common. Every device defines its own protocol, including whether it supports commands at all. Some devices are transmit-\/only; others are receive-\/only."

S\+PI is different from the Microwire TI S\+SI interfaces and implementations. According to Wikipedia, "The S\+PI may be accurately described as a synchronous serial interface, but it is different from the Synchronous Serial Interface (S\+SI) protocol, which is also a four-\/wire synchronous serial communication protocol."

For information on Microwire see this Wikipedia link \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface\#Microwire}{\texttt{ https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Serial\+\_\+\+Peripheral\+\_\+\+Interface\#\+Microwire}}

For more detailed information on the S\+SI module please see page 952 of the T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM datasheet @ \href{https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.pdf}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+ti.\+com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.\+pdf}}\hypertarget{classSsi_ssiSignalDescription}{}\doxysubsubsection{S\+S\+I Signal Description}\label{classSsi_ssiSignalDescription}
The following table lists the external signals and thier associtated pins for the S\+SI module. The G\+P\+IO needs to be configured for the S\+SI alternate function using the {\ttfamily A\+F\+S\+EL} bit in the G\+P\+IO Alternate Function \mbox{\hyperlink{classRegister}{Register}} (G\+P\+I\+O\+A\+F\+S\+EL). The number in parenthesis in the Pin Mux / Pin Assignment column of the table below is what is programmed into the {\ttfamily P\+M\+Cn} field in the G\+P\+IO Port Control (G\+P\+I\+O\+P\+C\+TL) register to assign a S\+SI signal to a G\+P\+IO.
