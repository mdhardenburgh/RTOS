The T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM a Direct Memory Access (D\+MA) controller, known as μ\+D\+MA. D\+MA provides a way to offload memory transfer tasks from the processor. the μ\+D\+MA controller transfers data between memory and peripherals and has a dedicated channel for each supported peripheral. The μ\+D\+MA controller can be programmed to automatically transfer data between peripherals and memory as soon as the peripheral is ready to transfer more data. The μ\+D\+MA controller has the following features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A\+R\+M® Prime\+Cell® 32-\/channel configurable µ\+D\+MA controller
\item Support for memory-\/to-\/memory, memory-\/to-\/peripheral, and peripheral-\/to-\/ memory in multiple transfer modes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Basic for simple transfer scenarios
\item Ping-\/pong for continuous data flow
\item Scatter-\/gather for a programmable list of up to 256 arbitrary transfers initiated from a single request
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Highly flexible and configurable channel operation
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Independently configured and operated channels
\item Dedicated channels for supported on-\/chip modules
\item Flexible channel assignments
\item One channel each for receive and transmit path for bidirectional modules
\item Dedicated channel for software-\/initiated transfers
\item Per-\/channel configurable priority scheme
\item Optional software-\/initiated requests for any channel
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Two levels of priority
\item Design optimizations for improved bus access performance between µ\+D\+MA controller and the processor core
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item µ\+D\+MA controller access is subordinate to core access
\item R\+AM striping
\item Peripheral bus segmentation
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Data sizes of 8, 16, and 32 bits
\item Transfer size is programmable in binary steps from 1 to 1024
\item Source and destination address increment size of byte, half-\/word, word, or no increment
\item Maskable peripheral requests
\item Interrupt on transfer completion, with a separate interrupt per channel
\end{DoxyItemize}

For more detailed information on the μ\+D\+MA please see page 585 of the T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM datasheet @ \href{https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.pdf}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+ti.\+com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.\+pdf}}\hypertarget{classDma_udmaSignalDescription}{}\doxysubsubsection{μ\+D\+M\+A Signal Description}\label{classDma_udmaSignalDescription}
Each D\+MA channel can be programmed with up to 5 possible assignments. There are 4 D\+MA Channel Map Select registers (D\+M\+A\+C\+H\+M\+A\+Pn) and each register has 8 4-\/bit assignment fields, making a total of 32 assignment fields, one field each for the 32 D\+MA channels.

The table below shows the μ\+D\+MA channel mappings. The {\ttfamily Enc}. column indicates the encoding the should be programmed into the D\+M\+A\+C\+H\+M\+A\+Pn bit field to use a channel with a specified peripheral. Encodings 0x5 to 0xF are reserved and not used. The {\ttfamily Type} column in the table indicates if a peripheral uses (S)ingle request, (B)urst request, or both (SB). Peripheral encodings that are \char`\"{}\+Software\char`\"{} may be assigned to peripherals in the future, but are currently available for software use. Channel 30 is dedicated to software use. U\+SB endpoints mapped to D\+MA channels 0-\/3 can be changed using the U\+SB register U\+S\+B\+D\+M\+A\+S\+EL
