\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM P\+WM Driver. 

\hypertarget{classPwm_pwmDescription}{}\doxysubsection{P\+W\+M Description}\label{classPwm_pwmDescription}
The T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM microcontroller has two P\+WM modules. Each module has 4 P\+WM generator blocks and each generator block produces 2 P\+WM signals that share the same P\+WM timer and frequency. The 2 P\+WM signals can be programmed to operate independently or as a pair of complementary signals and a dead-\/band delay can be inserted. The two output signals {\ttfamily pwmA} and {\ttfamily pwmB} of the device generation are managed by an output control block before they reach the device pins as {\ttfamily Mn\+P\+W\+M0} , {\ttfamily Mn\+P\+W\+M1} , {\ttfamily Mn\+P\+W\+M2} etc...

Each P\+WM generator block has the following features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item One fault-\/condition handling inputs to quickly provide low-\/latency shutdown and prevent damage to the motor being controlled, for a total of two inputs
\item One 16-\/bit counter
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Runs in Down or Up/\+Down mode
\item Output frequency controlled by a 16-\/bit load value
\item Load value updates can be synchronized
\item Produces output signals at zero and load value
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Two P\+WM comparators
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classComparator}{Comparator}} value updates can be synchronized
\item Produces output signals on match
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+WM signal generator
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Output P\+WM signal is constructed based on actions taken as a result of the counter and P\+WM comparator output signals
\item Produces two independent P\+WM signals
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Dead-\/band generator
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Produces two P\+WM signals with programmable dead-\/band delays suitable for driving a half-\/H bridge
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classCan}{Can}} be bypassed, leaving input P\+WM signals unmodified
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classCan}{Can}} initiate an A\+DC sample sequence
\end{DoxyItemize}

The P\+WM control block determines the polarity of the P\+WM signals that are passed through to the external microcontroller pins. The P\+WM control block has the following options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+WM output enable of each P\+WM signal
\item Optional output inversion of each P\+WM signal (polarity control)
\item Optional fault handling for each P\+WM signal
\item Synchronization of timers in the P\+WM generator blocks
\item Synchronization of timer/comparator updates across the P\+WM generator blocks
\item Extended P\+WM synchronization of timer/comparator updates across the P\+WM generator blocks
\item Interrupt status summary of the P\+WM generator blocks
\item Extended P\+WM fault handling, with multiple fault signals, programmable polarities, and filtering
\item P\+WM generators can be operated independently or synchronized with other generators
\end{DoxyItemize}

For more detailed information on the P\+WM please see page 1230 of the T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM datasheet @ \href{https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.pdf}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+ti.\+com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.\+pdf}}\hypertarget{classPwm_pwmSignalDescription}{}\doxysubsubsection{P\+W\+M Signal Description}\label{classPwm_pwmSignalDescription}
The following table lists the external signals and thier associtated pins for the P\+WM module. The G\+P\+IO needs to be configured for the P\+WM alternate function using the {\ttfamily A\+F\+S\+EL} bit in the G\+P\+IO Alternate Function \mbox{\hyperlink{classRegister}{Register}} (G\+P\+I\+O\+A\+F\+S\+EL). The number in parenthesis in the Pin Mux / Pin Assignment column of the table below is what is programmed into the {\ttfamily P\+M\+Cn} field in the G\+P\+IO Port Control (G\+P\+I\+O\+P\+C\+TL) register to assign a P\+WM signal to a G\+P\+IO.
