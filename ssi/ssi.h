 * @brief TM4C123GH6PM SSI Driver
 * 
 * @section ssiDescription SSI Description
 * 
 * The TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller has four SSI modules. The SSI is used to 
 * communicate with peripheral devices that have the Freescale SPI, Microwire or
 * TI SSI interfaces. Each SSI module can act as a master or slave. The
 * TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller SSI modules have the following features:
 *      - Programmable interface operation for Freescale SPI, MICROWIRE, or 
 *        Texas Instruments synchronous serial interfaces
 *      - Master or slave operation
 *      - Programmable clock bit rate and prescaler
 *      - Separate transmit and receive FIFOs, each 16 bits wide and 8 locations deep
 *      - Programmable data frame size from 4 to 16 bits
 *      - Internal loopback test mode for diagnostic/debug testing
 *      - Standard FIFO-based interrupts and End-of-Transmission interrupt
 *      - Efficient transfers using Micro Direct Memory Access Controller (ÂµDMA)
 *          - Separate channels for transmit and receive
 *          - Receive single request asserted when data is in the FIFO; burst 
 *            request asserted when FIFO contains 4 entries
 *          - Transmit single request asserted when there is space in the FIFO; 
 *            burst request asserted when four or more entries are available to 
 *            be written in the FIFO
 * 
 * @subsection spiCompatability Freescale SPI Compatability Information
 * 
 * Background information first, Freescale is a spinoff of Motorolla and was 
 * purchased by NXP Semiconductor. Motorola developed SPI in the mid 80s. "The 
 * Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus was put together by Motorola 
 * (Freescale/NXP/Qualcomm) in the 1980s for communicating between a 
 * processor and one or more external peripherals. SPI is intended for short 
 * distance communication, typically between chips on the same board." 
 * https://embedded.fm/blog/2017/3/24/i-spi
 * 
 * Generally, SPI is a name given to 4-wire serial communication 
 * protocol that is full duplex and uses a master-slave communication 
 * architecture with a single master (with the option of multiple slaves). While
 * most SPI interfaces and protocol impelementations are the same and compatable
 * with each other, <b> SOME ARE NOT!!! </b> Care must be taken to ensure that 
 * the SPI interfaces are compatable. According to Wikipedia, "the SPI bus is a 
 * de facto standard but not officially established. The lack of a formal standard is 
 * reflected in a wide variety of protocol options. Different word sizes are 
 * common. Every device  defines its own protocol, including whether it supports 
 * commands at all. Some devices are transmit-only; others are receive-only."
 * 
 * For more info on SPI compatability see the link to the following forum 
 * discussion https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/67876-1.php
 * 
 * Link to Freescale Semiconductor SPI application note
 * https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN3020.pdf
 * 
 * Link to another Freescale Semiconductor SPI application note that uses
 * a Freescale Microcontroller in the example.
 * https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN3904.pdf
 * 
 * For more information on SPI please see the folliwing Wikipeida link
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface
 * 
 * SPI is different from the Microwire TI SSI interfaces and implementations. 
 * According to Wikipedia, "The SPI may be accurately described as a synchronous 
 * serial interface, but it is different from the Synchronous Serial Interface 
 * (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire synchronous serial communication 
 * protocol."
 * 
 * For information on Microwire see this Wikipedia link 
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface#Microwire
 * 
 * For information on Synchronous Serial Interfaces (SSI) see this Wikipedia link
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_Serial_Interface
 * 
 * For more detailed information on the SSI module please see page 952 of the 
 * TM4C123GH6PM datasheet @ https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tm4c123gh6pm.pdf

 * @subsection ssiSignalDescription SSI Signal Description
 * 
 * The following table lists the external signals and thier associtated pins 
 * for the SSI module. The GPIO needs to be configured for the SSI alternate
 * function using the \c AFSEL bit in the GPIO Alternate Function Register 
 * (GPIOAFSEL). The number in parenthesis in the Pin Mux / Pin Assignment 
 * column of the table below is what is programmed into the \c PMCn field in
 * the GPIO Port Control (GPIOPCTL) register to assign a SSI signal to a GPIO.
