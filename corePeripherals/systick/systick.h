         * The STRELOAD register specifies the start value to load into the 
         * SysTick Current Value (STCURRENT) register when the counter reaches 0. 
         * The start value can be between 0x1 and 0x00FF.FFFF. A start value of 
         * 0 is possible but has no effect because the SysTick interrupt and the
         * COUNT bit are activated when counting from 1 to 0.
         * 
         * SysTick can be configured as a multi-shot timer, repeated over and 
         * over, firing every N+1 clock pulses, where N is any value from 1 to 
         * 0x00FF.FFFF. For example, if a tick interrupt is required every 100 
         * clock pulses, 99 must be written into the RELOAD field.
         * 
         * Note that in order to access this register correctly, the system 
         * clock must be faster than 8 MHz.
